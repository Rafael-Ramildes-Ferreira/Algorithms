\section*{Introduction}

Throughout the semester, some of the studied algorithms and data structures were implemented as a course assignment. They were initially implemented in C. The Gale-Shapley Algorithm was implemented in Python, for the built-in hash map (\texttt{dict}). Later C++ was used to implement the binary heap and binary tree, to make use of the class definition as a template.

The whole implementation as well as the \LaTeX source code and the report as a pdf are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Rafael-Ramildes-Ferreira/Algorithms}

The Implementation of the first two algorithms are explained and compared in \autoref{sec:sorting}. The Gale-Shapley algorithm is explained in \autoref{sec:gale-shapley}. The binary heap implementation and heap sort are discussed in \autoref{sec:binary-heap}. Finally, the binary tree implementation is presented in \autoref{sec:binary-tree}.
